# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

Yes, it was difficult for me to complete the function. I frequently found myself trying to do it on my own and getting confused, and to either look to one of my friends or Mr. Berg's examples for guidance. I am planning on to keep practicing so that I become a little better. 

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

You can use this function for extracting information from a movie database by providing a pattern and a source (list of words representing a phrase). The function can match the pattern to the source, where '%' matches a sequence of zero or more words, and '_' matches any single word. If the pattern and source match, the function will return a list of matched words from the source. If there's no match, it will return None. It is similar to how it functions now, but with different parameters.
